# Installing cargo-hauler

The npm package (`npm install -g cargo-hauler`) carries one ready-made plugin
root, `artifact/`, that Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Agent Plugins hosts
all read (its `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, and
`.agents/` manifests point at one set of files) — plus three executables in
`dist/bin/`: `hauler` (the CLI), `cargo-hauler` (the routed commands), and
`cargo-hauler-install`. Installing needs only Node and the host; the
agent-bundle framework that builds the root is a development dependency
only, and the plugin and installer never load it.

The CLI entry point is `hauler` on PATH from `npm i -g cargo-hauler`. Never
run `scripts/hauler.mjs` or a path under `.claude/plugins/cache`,
`.codex/plugins/cache`, `.cursor/plugins`, or `artifact/` directly.

After an upgrade, every CLI command, MCP tool, dashboard read, and hook checks
the daemon version before requesting a versioned payload. A daemon from the
previous install is shut down and replaced, then the operation is tried once
against the new daemon. If the old process does not exit within 5 seconds, the
operation fails with one replacement diagnostic; it never parses the old
payload or falls back to a compatibility schema.

Supported platforms: Linux and macOS. Windows is experimental and untested
(the daemon endpoint resolves to a named pipe, but the cargo PATH shim is
POSIX-only and refuses to install). Node >= 22.19 is required (`node:sqlite`).

## Build

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build   # or `pnpm run check` to also run the typecheck and test gate
```

The root ships `mcp/` (the `hauler` MCP server), `hooks/` (one hook document
per host and the four event routes — `session/start`, `stop`, and the
`tool/before` / `tool/after` shell routes, whose preflight gates decide on the
raw command before the route itself loads), `skills/`, `scripts/hauler.mjs`
(the internal `exec` / `daemon run` entry used by hooks), `bin/cargo-hauler.mjs`
(the routed CLI: `status`, `log`, `last`, `await`, `result`, `request`, `kill`,
`daemon`, and `web`, which serves the dashboard App in a browser),
`mcp-apps/dashboard.html`, and an `INSTALL.md` with the exact compiled names.

The hooks never introduce a permission prompt. The `tool/before` hook answers
`allow` only when every command in the input is a cargo invocation it has
rewritten onto the hauler exec path (or already runs through it) — the daemon
governs the whole command. A cargo command beside something the daemon does
not govern (`cd crates/foo && cargo build`, `cargo test | tail -20`) is still
rewritten but returned as `continue`, so the host's own permission flow
decides the rewritten command exactly as it would have decided the original.
`deny` is returned only for a destructive cargo command that would race
in-flight builds, and plain `continue` — no decision — for every other tool
call. No hook returns `ask`.

## Install

Every pack installs through its host's own plugin commands; the package also
ships `cargo-hauler-install`, which runs those commands for you and handles
same-version replacement. Neither needs the agent-bundle framework.

From the npm package:

```sh
npm install -g cargo-hauler
cargo-hauler-install install claude --scope user
cargo-hauler-install install codex
cargo-hauler-install install cursor --mode local
```

Or the host commands directly, from `artifact/` (in the package or a
checkout — its `INSTALL.md` repeats them with the compiled names):

```sh
(cd artifact && claude plugin marketplace add ./ && claude plugin install cargo-hauler@cargo-hauler-marketplace --scope user)
(cd artifact && codex plugin marketplace add ./  && codex plugin add cargo-hauler@cargo-hauler-marketplace)
node artifact/install.mjs [--mode local|marketplace] [--replace]
```

- `--replace` (alias `--force`) on `cargo-hauler-install` and on the Cursor
  `install.mjs` replaces a different installed version or adopts a
  pre-receipt copy; a same-version rebuild is replaced in place (owned files
  only, `state/` survives). Claude's `plugin update` is version-gated, so a
  same-version rebuild needs `claude plugin uninstall … --keep-data` then a
  fresh install; Codex needs `codex plugin remove …` then `marketplace add` +
  `plugin add`. The installer performs these sequences itself.
- `cargo-hauler-install … --json` prints the outcome (`installed`, `replaced`,
  `current`, `refused`) for scripts. `npm install` itself never mutates a host.
- Contributors with the framework available can also use
  `pnpm exec agent-bundle install <host> --from artifact` and
  `agent-bundle doctor --host <host>` (installed copy versus artifact:
  `current`, `stale`, `version-mismatch`, `foreign`, `not-installed`); they
  apply the same policy.

## Per-host notes

### Claude Code

- The installer adds the pack as a local marketplace and installs
  `cargo-hauler@cargo-hauler-marketplace` at the requested scope (`user`,
  `project`, or `local`). The pack's `INSTALL.md` lists the equivalent
  `claude plugin marketplace add` / `claude plugin install` commands.
- Hook events: `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop` (matcher
  `^Bash$` for the tool hooks). Timeouts: 5 s, 10 s, 10 s, 900 s. The
  stop-hold implementation bounds each wait to ~30 s and re-denies, so a
  single hook process never becomes a marathon.
- Claude's shell tool has historically killed cargo around 10 minutes. The
  client auto-backgrounds when a measured cost-model ETA (not the cold-start
  default) exceeds 9 minutes, and exits 75 so the caller knows nothing ran yet.

### Cursor

- `--mode local` (default) safe-copies the pack into
  `~/.cursor/plugins/local/cargo-hauler`, records an install receipt, and
  refuses foreign directories. Cursor registers the plugin's hooks from the
  manifest alone (`hooks/hooks.json`): `sessionStart`, `preToolUse` and
  `postToolUse` (matcher `^Shell$`), and `stop`. Reload Cursor
  (`Developer: Reload Window`) so new sessions pick them up.
- `--mode marketplace` stages a committed Git repository at
  `~/.cursor/agent-bundle/marketplaces/cargo-hauler` and prints the one
  Cursor-owned step: Customize → Plugins → Add Plugins from Local Repository →
  select that directory → Install. Cursor then lists the plugin under
  Customize as a marketplace install rather than "local".
- The PATH shim (below) additionally covers Cargo that Cursor runs outside
  the hooked shell tool.

### Codex CLI

- The installer adds the pack as a local marketplace snapshot and installs
  `cargo-hauler@cargo-hauler-marketplace`.
- Hook schema mirrors Claude (`SessionStart` / `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` /
  `Stop`).
- Stop-hook behavior is **verified on Codex 0.147.0** by a live probe: holds
  of ~29 s and ~72 s ran to their own wait bound and delivered their deny
  intact, and the re-deny loop (`stopHookActive` re-entry) works. Details and
  quirks in [codex-hooks.md](codex-hooks.md).
- **Hook trust gates everything**: without persisted trust in
  `~/.codex/config.toml` (`[hooks.state]`) or
  `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`, Codex does not run the hooks at all.
- If a Stop hook is ever cut off mid-hold anyway: shorten the in-hook wait
  (`CARGO_HAULER_STOP_WAIT_MS`, default 30000) and rely on the re-deny loop.

### Portable (Agent Plugins 1.0.0)

The root's `.agents/` projection is the open-standard view: skills and the
MCP server only (the standard defines no hooks), loaded natively by Cursor,
Codex, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, and ChatGPT, and used by the
agent-bundle Workbench playground. `install.mjs` copies it for
Cursor-compatible hosts.

## Optional PATH shim

Hooks cannot see `cargo` spawned from scripts. Install the global package and
run the CLI from PATH; the shim embeds that global entry's realpath:

```sh
npm i -g cargo-hauler
hauler install-shim            # defaults to ~/.local/bin
hauler install-shim --dir DIR  # or pick another user-writable dir
```

`install-shim` refuses unknown flags instead of installing on, say, `--help`.
The shim only works if its directory resolves `cargo` **before** rustup's
`~/.cargo/bin` on `PATH`; prepend it in your shell profile
(`export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`). `install-shim` checks this after
installing and warns when `cargo` still resolves elsewhere.

The generated shim is self-contained
([issue #2](https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy/cargo-hauler/issues/2)): it
embeds the absolute `node <script>` invocation of the `hauler` found on PATH
(only an npm-shaped `dist/bin/hauler.js` entry embeds itself, and only when no
`hauler` on PATH resolves to a regular `.js`, `.mjs`, or `.cjs` file outside a
plugin copy — so a checkout never shadows an installed global that PATH can see) and an absolute real-cargo path (the `~/.cargo/bin/cargo` link,
not its canonical rustup target — rustup dispatches on `argv[0]`). It submits
with `--host shim`, and passes daemon-spawned cargo straight through
(`CARGO_HAULER_INSIDE=1`). On the daemon side, bare `cargo` argv never
resolves through PATH: the daemon uses `CARGO_HAULER_CARGO_BIN` when set,
otherwise `$CARGO_HOME/bin/cargo`, otherwise a bare `cargo` as the last
resort.

## State

Daemon socket and ledger live under a per-user cache directory:
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cargo-hauler` when `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is set, otherwise
`~/.cache/cargo-hauler` on Linux, `~/Library/Caches/cargo-hauler` on
macOS, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\cargo-hauler` on Windows. Set
`CARGO_HAULER_STATE_DIR` to relocate it.

kache is optional. When `CARGO_HAULER_KACHE_INDEX` is unset, the daemon
reads kache's own config (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kache/config.toml`, else
`~/.config/kache/config.toml`) for the `local_store` path under `[cache]` and
uses `<local_store>/index.db`; without that config it falls back to
`kache/index.db` under the same per-user cache base. An empty string disables
the lookup entirely; a missing file just reports kache as unavailable.
