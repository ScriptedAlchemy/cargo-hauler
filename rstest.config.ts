 * The framework preset runs one compiler pass and aliases the reserved
 * `agent-bundle/meta` specifier to a generated module carrying exactly the
 * `{ name, packageName, packageVersion, version }` a build would stamp, so
 * source modules such as `src/internal/daemon/main.ts` and `src/layout.tsx` load here
 * with the package identity instead of raising `AB4760`.
 *
 * Only that alias is adopted. The preset's `react-server` pool conditions are
 * for the route-unit level (`rstest.route-unit.config.ts`), which also hosts
 * the workbench-surface proof.
