    <h1>hauler-dashboard</h1>
    <p>
      Use the dashboard for machine-wide fleet state (cargo-hauler {version}). Use the <code>cargo-hauler</code>{' '}
      Skill for submitting, scoping, or waiting on work.
    </p>
    <h2>Open it</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>MCP App host:</strong> call <code>{mcpSurface.dashboard}</code>. Hosts that render MCP Apps attach{' '}
        <code>{APP_RESOURCE_URI}</code> beside its result; the text result is one summary line. For the queue as
        text — daemon badge, admission meter, lane board, in-flight and recent tickets, kache summary — call{' '}
        <code>{mcpSurface.status}</code>, which never opens the App.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plain browser:</strong> run <code>node &lt;plugin root&gt;/bin/cargo-hauler.mjs web</code> — the
        installed plugin's own <code>web</code> command (the root is the directory holding{' '}
        <code>agent-bundle.manifest.json</code>; in a checkout, <code>artifact/</code>). It serves the App
        standalone against the plugin's own <code>hauler</code> server, opens it, and stays in the foreground until
        Ctrl-C; the panels show the daemon's own data and poll every five seconds. From the plugin checkout,{' '}
        <code>pnpm run dev</code> and the Workbench's MCP page preview <code>{APP_RESOURCE_URI}</code> the same way.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Read the panels</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Contention:</strong> machine load, CPU I/O wait, disk pressure, and admission permits.{' '}
        <code>3/5 +1 riding</code> means three real Cargo processes hold permits and one request is sharing
        existing work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>In flight / Queue:</strong> active leaders and waiting tickets, including workspace, submitter,
        elapsed/wait time, and cost estimate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Metrics:</strong> switch among <code>1h</code>, <code>24h</code>, and <code>all</code>. Run
        counts, outcomes, and percentiles use the selected window. Compute avoided, latency saved, and riders
        served are all-time SQLite-ledger totals. Latency compares each rider's solo estimate with the time it
        rode a started leader — waiting behind a leader that had not started yet is lane wait, not a cost of
        attaching — and negative values (the leader ran longer than the rider alone would have) are included.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Queue wait vs run:</strong> per window, total queue wait against total run time for leaders,
        and the wait split by cause. <em>Lane-bound</em> is time a same-lane leader was still compiling (before
        its <code>Finished</code> line or exit); <em>permit-bound</em> is time every admission permit was held
        with no same-lane compile to blame; <em>other</em> is admission holds, <code>--after</code>{' '}
        prerequisites, and scheduling latency. The permit split assumes the daemon's current permit count —
        the caption says so — and "lane time released by hand-back" is the execution time of test and run
        leaders that ran with their lane already handed to the next compile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>By command:</strong> run timings per subcommand and profile, each with its own n. Commands
        that execute after building (test, run, bench) add a compile-vs-exec line from the leaders that handed
        back; pure compiles never do, so <code>cargo check</code> shows none.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Kache:</strong> optional machine-wide cache freshness, active compile roots, and slowest crates
        grouped by profile, plus store pressure: blob bytes against kache's <code>local_max_size</code> (read
        from <code>KACHE_MAX_SIZE</code> or its config; "limit unknown" names why when it cannot be), the last
        GC from <code>gc_stats.json</code> with any <code>skipping eviction</code> warnings matched from kache's
        logs, and <code>key_ms</code> mean/p95 from the events sidecar. Warnings appear when the store is over
        its limit or the last GC declined or skipped evictions. No panel means kache is unavailable or
        disabled, not that the daemon failed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lanes:</strong> work grouped by resolved <code>(workspace root, target dir)</code>. Only lanes
        with queued or running work are active.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>History:</strong> finished tickets and the command each request actually ran as, including
        composite batch expansion.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Click an in-flight row to open its live output drawer. It refreshes every three seconds. Completed and
      queued rows show their durable ledger state.
    </p>
    <h2>Diagnose contention</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Check the admission meter before assuming the daemon is stalled.</li>
      <li>Match queued work to its lane and current leader.</li>
      <li>
        Filter with <code>{cliSurface.status}</code>{' '}
        {filters.map((flag, index) => (
          <React.Fragment key={flag}>
            {index === 0 ? '' : ', '}
            <code>{flag}</code>
          </React.Fragment>
        ))}{' '}
        (or the equivalent structured fields of <code>{mcpSurface.status}</code>); do not replace the dashboard
        with <code>ps</code> polling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Await or attach to the ticket with <code>{mcpSurface.await}</code> / <code>{cliSurface.await}</code>. Do
        not kill Cargo to clear a lane.
      </li>
    </ol>
