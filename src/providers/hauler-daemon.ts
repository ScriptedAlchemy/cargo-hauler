/**
 * The daemon connection for one request, mounted at
 * `(await agent()).providers.haulerDaemon` (and `useAgent().providers.haulerDaemon`
 * in synchronous components) for every generated MCP tool, routed CLI
 * command, and rendered script. Event routes declare `providers: []` and
 * probe for themselves within their own budget when they need to.
 *
 * `config` is where the daemon lives (state dir, socket, ledger) resolved
 * once from the environment; `health` is what one bounded probe proved about
 * it at request start. A probe never fabricates status: a missing socket or
 * refused connection is `stopped`, an accept that did not finish in time is
 * `unresponsive`.
