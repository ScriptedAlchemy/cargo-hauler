/**
 * Pure classification of leaders' queue wait (#92), fed by the ledger's
 * metrics-window scan. Kept free of SQL so the interval arithmetic is
 * testable on hand-built rows.
 *
 * A leader waits in `[queuedAt, startedAt)`. During that wait each instant
 * is attributed to exactly one cause, in this precedence:
 *
 * - lane-bound: another leader in the same lane was still compiling, i.e.
 *   between its start and its build-finished stamp (or its finish, for pure
 *   compiles and for rows older than the hand-back);
 * - permit-bound: every admission permit was held by a running leader,
 *   anywhere on the machine, and no same-lane head was compiling — a leader
 *   keeps its permit through its execution phase, so this window runs from
 *   start to finish;
 * - other: admission holds (memory, load, heavy cap), `--after`
 *   prerequisites, and scheduling latency.
